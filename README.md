# Wildfires and Extracellular Vesicles (EVs): Woodsmoke Alters EV Proteomic Signatures involved in Extracellular Matrix Degradation and Tissue Injury in Airway Organotypic Models 

> As wildfires become more common, this study sought to investigate how extracellular vesicles (EVs) are impacted by in vitro smoke exposure from various biomasses.

# 1. Data Extraction
- Extracting particle concentrations to compare between treatment groups (co-culture and tri-culture) in a visualization later on

# 2. PDF Data Visualization (Figure 3)
- Figure of extracted PDF data visualizing unexposed and exposed tri-cultures and co-culture groups
- Tested for differences between groups using ANOVA tests

# 3. Proteomics Data Processing
- Normalized, implemented background filters, imputed missing proteomics data, and removed sample outliers

# 4. Group Distribution Analysis (Table S2 & Table S3)
- Used t tests to determine compare protein abundance distributions between co-culture unexposed vs. exposed and tri-culture unexposed vs. exposed groups
- Calculated overall log~2~ transformed abundances and stratified by set (co-culture and tri-culture)

# 5. Volcano Plot (Figure 4)
- Visualizes significance (p adjusted value) and expression degree/direction (fold change) of proteins in both co and tri-culture treatments

# 6. Hierarchical Clustering Heatmap (Figure 5)
- Hiearchical clustering of of samples to see if exposure groups would group together based on scaled log~2~ protein expression
